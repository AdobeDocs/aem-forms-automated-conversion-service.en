# Introduction to Automated Forms Conversion service{#introduction-to-automated-forms-conversion-service}

Automated Forms Conversion service helps accelerate digitization and modernization of data capture experience through automated conversion of print forms to adaptive forms. The service, powered by Adobe Sensei, automatically converts your PDF forms to device-friendly and responsive adaptive forms. While leveraging the existing investments in PDF Forms, the service also applies appropriate validations to adaptive form fields during conversion. The service helps:

* Save manual effort required to convert print forms to adaptive forms
* Generate reusable adaptive form fragments
* Generate Document of Record during conversion
* Apply patterns and appropriate validations during conversion
* Enables Adobe Analytics during conversion

Can a visual help better? Lots of bullet points to read for an overview. Or reduce word count. One way is to not write full sentences.

Sounds like it should come before workflow. If it must come after w/f then elaborate in title what is being overboarded. Gerund.

The service is available for free to AEM Forms 6.4 and later On-Premise term customers and Adobe Managed Service enterprise customers. To request access to the service for your organization, send an email to [afc-beta@adobe.com](mailto:afc-beta@adobe.com) with the following details:

* Name of your organization or business unit.  
* Name, email address, and designation of an AEM administrator. Create an Adobe ID with similar email address.  
* Geographic region and country of the administrator and other users. For example, EMEA, APAC, U.S.A.

Adobe will enable access for your organization, provide required privileges to the administrator, and a link to Adobe I/O. The administrator can configure and connect your local AEM instance with Automated Forms Conversion service running on Adobe Cloud. See [integrate the Automated Forms Conversion service](configure-the-automated-forms-conversion-service.md) for details.

The service converts only English-language forms to adaptive forms. You can translate the output adaptive forms to another language using [AEM translation workflow](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/forms/using/using-aem-translation-workflow-to-localize-adaptive-forms.html).

The service supports PDF forms created with any version of AEM Forms or Adobe LiveCycle, going all the way back to AEM 6.0 Forms and Adobe LiveCycle ES3. The service also supports forms created with Adobe Acrobat.

The service supports non-interactive PDF forms, AcroForms, and XFA-based forms. [AcroForms and XFA-based forms has a limited support](/known-issues/jcr:content.md).

<li><p><strong>Install AEM Forms add-on package and Conversion Manager package:</strong> Install <a href="aem-forms-automated-forms-conversion-service-beta.md" target="_blank">AEM Forms add-on package</a> to avail AEM Forms capabilities and <a href="aem-forms-automated-forms-conversion-service-beta.md" target="_blank">Conversion Manager</a> package to avail conversion service capabilities.</p> </li>
<li><p><strong>Create an adaptive form theme:</strong> You can use a theme to provide a unique or organization-specific appearance to your adaptive forms. You can apply an out-of-the-box theme provided with adaptive forms or <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/forms/using/themes.html">create a custom theme</a> of your own.</p> </li>
<li><p><strong>Create an adaptive form template: </strong>A template contains a set of adaptive form components common for a set of forms. For example, identical header, footer, and logo for the forms of an organization. You can use the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/forms/using/template-editor.html">template editor</a> to create a template. </p> </li>

It also allows the service to pre-configure validations, rules, data patterns, help text, and accessibility properties of adaptive form components. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/forms/using/wip/extending-the-default-meta-model.html">Extend the default meta-model</a> to add organization-specific mapping and validations.</p> </li>

### 2. Use the conversion service {#use-the-conversion-service}

After your AEM Forms environment is configured, to convert your print forms to adaptive forms, [upload source forms](convert-existing-forms-to-adaptive-forms.md) to your AEM instance and [start the conversion](convert-existing-forms-to-adaptive-forms.md#run-the-conversion). Before uploading the forms, consider the following:

* Do not upload the protected forms. The service does not convert password-protected and encrypted forms. 
* Do not upload scanned, coloured, non-English language, and filled forms. Such forms are not supported.  
* Do not upload source forms with spaces in the filename.  
* Make the suggested changes in source forms described in the [Best practices and considerations](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/forms/using/wip/styles-and-pattern--considerations-and-best-practices-.html) article.
* Read the [Known issues](aem-forms-automated-forms-conversion-service-beta.md) article to avoid pitfalls.

### 3. Review converted forms {#review-converted-forms}

Your forms can have complex data capture requirements. Once automated conversion is complete, you can use the [Review and Correct editor](review-correct-ui-edited.md) to review converted form and make necessary updates and generate an enhanced output closer to desired experience. After making required changes, send the form again for the conversion.

Conversion of a PDF form to an adaptive form could some take time due to multiple factors such as size of input form, complexity of the form, loan on the processing queue of the service. When the conversion is complete, an email notification is sent to configured email address.
