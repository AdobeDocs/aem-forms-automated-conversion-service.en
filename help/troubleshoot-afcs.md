|**Error Message** <br> The number of pages is more than 15.  <br><br>**Reason** <br> The source form is more than 15 pages long.  <br><br>**Resolution** <br> Use Adobe Acrobat to split forms with more than 15 pages. Bring the number of pages in a form to less than 15. |![Unable to connect to the service.](assets/number-of-pages.png)|
|**Error Message** <br> The number of files is more than 15.  <br><br>**Reason** <br>  The folder contains more than 15 forms. <br><br>**Resolution** <br> Bring the number of forms in a folder to less than or equal to 15.

|**Error Message** <br> Unable to parse meta-model JSON schema.  <br><br>**Reason** <br> The JSON schema supplied to the service is not properly formatted, contains invalid characters, or uses invalid syntax to map components.  <br><br>**Resolution** <br> Check the formatting of the JSON file. You can use any online JSON validator to check the formatting and structure of the schema.
