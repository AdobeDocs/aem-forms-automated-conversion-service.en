## Configure the service {#configure-the-service}

Before you proceed to configure the service and connect your local instance with the service running on Adobe Cloud, learn about the personas and privileges required to connect to the service. The service uses two different types of personas, administrators and developers:

* **Administrators**: Administrators are responsible for managing Adobe software and services for their organization. Administrators grant access to developers in their organization to connect to Automated Forms Conversion service running on Adobe Cloud. When an administrator is provisioned for an organization, the administrator receives an email with title ****[!UICONTROL 'You now have administrator rights to manage Adobe software and services for your organization']****. If you are an administrator, check your mailbox for email with aforementioned title and proceed to [grant access to developers of your organization](#adduseranddevs).

### (For administrators only) Grant access to developers of your organization {#adduseranddevs}

After Adobe enables access for your organization and provides required privileges to the administrator, the administrator can log into Admin Console (detailed instructions below), create a profile, and add developers to the profile. Developers can connect a local instance of AEM Forms to Automated Forms Conversion service on Adobe Cloud.

Developers are members of your organization designated to run the conversion service. Only those developers which are added to Adobe Automated Forms Conversion service profile are entitled to use the Automated Forms Conversion service. Perform the below steps to create a profile and add developers to it:

1. Log in to [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). Click the **Automated Forms Conversion** option.

   >[!CAUTION]
   >
   >Use **Adobe ID **of administrator provisioned to use Automated Forms Conversion service to login. Do not any other ID or Federated ID to login.

   ![Click the Automated Forms Converion option under Products.  ](assets/create-profile-open-automated-forms-conversion-service-adminconsole.png)

1. Click** New Profile** in the **Products **tab.

   ![Click the New Profile option. ](assets/create-new-profile.png)

1. Specify **Name**, **Display Name**, and **Description** for the profile. Click **Done**. A profile is created.

   ![Specify details for the new profile.](assets/create-new-profile-details.png)

1. ![Add Developers](assets/add-developers.png)

   Once an administrator adds developers to Adobe I/O profile, the developers are notified via email. After receiving the email, the developers can proceed to [connect a local AEM Forms instance with Automated Forms Conversion service on Adobe Cloud](#connectafcadobeio).

### (For developers only) Connect your local AEM Forms instance to Automated Forms Conversion service on Adobe Cloud {#connectafcadobeio}

After an administrator provides you developer access, you can connect your local AEM Forms instance to Automated Forms conversion service running on Adobe Cloud. Perform the following steps in the listed sequence to connect your AEM Forms instance to the service:

* [Configure email notifications and add user to the forms-users group](configure-the-automated-forms-conversion-service.md#configureemailnotification)
* [Obtain public certificates](#obtainpubliccertificates)
* [Create Adobe I/O integration](#createintegration)
* [Configure the cloud service](configure-the-automated-forms-conversion-service.md#configure-the-cloud-service)

#### Configure email notification and add user to the forms-users group {#configureemailnotification}

#### Configure the cloud service {#configure-the-cloud-service}

Create a cloud service configuration to connect your AEM instance to the conversion service. It also allows you to specify a template, theme, and form fragments for a conversion. You can create multiple cloud service configurations separate for each set of forms. For example, you can have a separate configuration for sales department forms and a separate one for customer support forms. Perform the following steps to create a cloud service configuration:

1. On your AEM Forms instance, tap **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager]** > **[!UICONTROL Tools]**> **[!UICONTROL Cloud Services]** > **[!UICONTROL Automate Forms Conversion Configuration]**.
1. Tap the **[!UICONTROL **Global**]**folder and tap ****[!UICONTROL Create]****. The page to create Automated Forms Conversion configuration appears. The configuration is created in the Global folder. You can also create the configuration in a different folder that already exists or create a new folder for your configurations.

1. On the **[!UICONTROL Create Automated Forms Conversion Configuration]** page, specify value for the following fields and tap **Next**.

|Field|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Title|Unique title for the configuration. The title is displayed in the UI used to start conversion.|
|Name|Unique name for the configuration. The configuration is saved in the CRX-Repository with the specified name. The name can be identical to the title.|
|Thumbnail location|Location of the thumbnail for the configuration.|
|Service URL|URL of the Automated Forms Conversion service on Adobe Cloud. Use the `https://aemformsconversion.adobe.io/` URL.|
|Template|Default template to be applied to converted forms. You can always specify a different template before starting the conversion. A template contains basic structure and initial content for an adaptive form. You can choose a template from the templates provided out-of-the-box. You can also create a custom template.|
|Theme|Default theme to be applied to converted forms. You can always specify a different theme before starting the conversion.  You can click the icon to choose a theme provided out-of the box. You can also create a custom theme.|
|Existing Fragments|Location of existing fragments, if any.|
|Custom Meta-model|Path of the .schema.json file of custom meta-model.|

   ![Conversion Settings Dialog](assets/conversion-settings.png)

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Advanced]**tab of the **[!UICONTROL Create Automated Forms Conversion Configuration]** page, specify value for the following field:

|Field|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Generate Document of Record|Select the option to automatically generate Document of Record for converted forms. The option is only for XFA-based forms (XDP and PDF Forms). When you enable the option, after submitting a form, you can allow your customers to keep a record, in print or in document format, of the information they have filled in the form for their future reference. This is referred to as a document of record.|
|Enable Analytics|Select the option to enable Adobe Analytics on all the converted forms. Before using the option, ensure Adobe Analytics is enabled for your AEM Forms instance.|

    * When the source is an XFA-based form with extension .XDP, then the output DOR retains the XFA layout, else the conversion service uses an out-of-the-box template to generate DOR for other XFA-based forms.
    * When an XFA form is submitted, submit data of the form is saved as an XML element or an attribute. For example, &lt;Amount currency="USD"&gt;10.00&lt;/Amount&gt;. The currency is saved as an attribute and currency amount, 10.00 is saved as an element. Submit data of an adaptive form does not have attributes, it has only elements. So, when an XFA-based form is converted to adaptive form, the adaptive form submit data contains an element for each such attribute. For example,

```css
   {

                  "Type": "Principal",

                  "Amount": "10.00",

                  "currency": "USD"

     }
```

1. Tap** Create**. The cloud configuration is created. Your AEM Forms instance is ready to start converting legacy forms to adaptive forms.
